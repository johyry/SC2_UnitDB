A finnish professional StarCraft 2 player Serral has noticed that a wiki located at http://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Unit_Statistics_(Legacy_of_the_Void)#tab-1 is too messy for his own purposes. He decides to order a better website from a computer science student.

The purpose of the system is to offer User a possibility to: add, edit and delete Units; add, edit and delete Buildorders; view other users Units and Buildorders.
